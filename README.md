# Password_Manager

This was a project created by me using entirely python and with help of kivymd. It's main purpose is to save passwords of different things securely ensuring that no-one other than user can use it. 

It had 2 Versions, the older one is less secure and can be used for experimentation mostly.
The newer version (**PassLOCK - The Password Manager**) though never saves your master password.
Thus, even this app doesn't know what your password is after you gave it, it just uses it to encrypt other passwords.
Due to use of AES encryption one can't decrypt passwords without using correct key.
Thus it can securely encrypt and decypt passwords.
